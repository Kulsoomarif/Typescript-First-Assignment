//10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write
//because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence
//describing what the program does.
var num1 = 22;
var num2 = 22;
//I will add this in typescript for adding we add plus sign in console.
console.log(num1 + num2);
var person1 = "This is Ahmed";
var message = "".concat(person1, ",\"He is my brother.\"");
//Here I use two strings to write message and name.
console.log(message);
