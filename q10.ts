//10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write
//because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence
//describing what the program does.

let num1 : number =22;
let num2 : number =22;
//I will add this in typescript for adding we add plus sign in console.

console.log(num1 + num2);

let person1 : string = "This is Ahmed"
let message : string = `${person1},"He is my brother."`
//Here I use two strings to write message and name.
console.log (message);
