// 23.	Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
// let car = 'subaru';
// console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
// console.log(car == 'subaru')
// • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
// • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.
